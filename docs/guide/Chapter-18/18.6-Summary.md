## 18.6 Summary

* Spring applications can be deployed in a number of different environments, including traditional application servers and PaaS environments like Cloud Foundry, or as Docker containers.
* Building as an executable JAR file allows a Spring Boot application to be deployed to several cloud platforms without the overhead of a WAR file.
* When building a WAR file, you should include a class that subclasses `SpringBootServletInitializr` to ensure that Spring’s `DispatcherServlet` is properly configured.
* Containerizing Spring applications is as simple as using the Spring Boot build plugin’s support for building images. These images can then be deployed anywhere Docker containers can be deployed, including in Kubernetes clusters.
