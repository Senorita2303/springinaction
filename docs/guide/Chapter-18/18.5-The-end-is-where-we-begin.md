## 18.5 The end is where we begin

Over the past several hundred pages, we’ve gone from a simple start—or start.spring.io, more specifically—to deploying an application in the cloud. I hope that you’ve had as much fun working through these pages as I’ve had writing them.

But while this book must come to an end, your Spring adventure is just beginning. Using what you’ve learned in these pages, go build something amazing with Spring. I can’t wait to see what you come up with!
