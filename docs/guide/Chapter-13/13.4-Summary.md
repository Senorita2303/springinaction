## 13.4 Summary

* Spring Data supports reactive persistence for a variety of database types, including relational databases (with R2DBC), MongoDB, and Cassandra.
* Spring Data R2DBC offers a reactive option for relational persistence but doesnâ€™t yet directly support relationships in domain classes.
* For lack of direct relationship support, Spring Data R2DBC repositories require a different approach to domain and database table design.
* Spring Data MongoDB and Spring Data Cassandra offer a near-identical programming model for writing reactive repositories for MongoDB and Cassandra databases.
* Using Spring Data test annotations along with `StepVerifier`, you can test automatically created reactive repositories from the Spring application context.
