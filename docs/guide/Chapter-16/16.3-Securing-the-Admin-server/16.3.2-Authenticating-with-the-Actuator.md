### 16.3.2 Authenticating with the Actuator

In section 15.4, we discussed how to secure Actuator endpoints with HTTP Basic authentication. By doing so, you’ll be able to keep out everyone who doesn’t know the username and password you assigned to the Actuator endpoints. Unfortunately, that also means that the Admin server won’t be able to consume Actuator endpoints unless it provides the username and password. But how will the Admin server get those credentials?

If the application registers directly with the Admin server, then it can send its credentials to the server at registration time. You’ll need to configure a few properties to enable that.

The `spring.boot.admin.client.username` and `spring.boot.admin.client.password` properties specify the credentials that the Admin server can use to access an application’s Actuator endpoints. The following snippet from application.yml shows how you might set those properties:

```yaml
spring:
  boot:
    admin:
      client:
        url: http://localhost:9090
        username: admin
        password: 53cr3t
```

The username and password properties must be set in each application that registers itself with the Admin server. The values given must match the username and password that’s required in an HTTP Basic authentication header to the Actuator endpoints. In this example, they’re set to admin and password, which are the credentials configured to access the Actuator endpoints.
