## 7.4 Summary

* REST endpoints can be created with Spring MVC, with controllers that follow the same programming model as browser-targeted controllers.
* Controller handler methods can either be annotated with `@ResponseBody` or return `ResponseEntity` objects to bypass the model and view and write data directly to the response body.
* The `@RestController` annotation simplifies REST controllers, eliminating the need to use `@ResponseBody` on handler methods.
* Spring Data repositories can automatically be exposed as REST APIs using Spring Data REST.
