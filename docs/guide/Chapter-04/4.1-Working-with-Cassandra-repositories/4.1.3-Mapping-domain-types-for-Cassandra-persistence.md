### 4.1.3 Mapping domain types for Cassandra persistence

In chapter 3, you marked up your domain types (`Taco`, `Ingredient`, `TacoOrder`, and so on) with annotations provided by the JPA specification. These annotations mapped your domain types as entities to be persisted to a relational database. Although those annotations won’t work for Cassandra persistence, Spring Data Cassandra provides its own set of mapping annotations for a similar purpose.

Let’s start with the `Ingredient` class, because it’s the simplest to map for Cassandra. The new Cassandra-ready `Ingredient` class looks like this:

```java
package tacos;

import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.PrimaryKey;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.Table;

import lombok.AccessLevel;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor(access=AccessLevel.PRIVATE, force=true)
@Table("ingredients")
public class Ingredient {

  @PrimaryKey
  private String id;
  private String name;
  private Type type;

  public static enum Type {
    WRAP, PROTEIN, VEGGIES, CHEESE, SAUCE
  }

}
```

The `Ingredient` class seems to contradict everything I said about just swapping out a few annotations. Rather than annotating the class with `@Entity` as you did for JPA persistence, it’s annotated with `@Table` to indicate that ingredients should be persisted to a table named ingredients. And rather than annotate the id property with `@Id`, this time it’s annotated with `@PrimaryKey`. So far, it seems that you’re only swapping out a few annotations.

But don’t let the `Ingredient` mapping fool you. The `Ingredient` class is one of your simplest domain types. Things get more interesting when you map the `Taco` class for Cassandra persistence, as shown in the next listing.

**Listing 4.1 Annotating the Taco class for Cassandra persistence**

```java
package tacos;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.UUID;

import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import javax.validation.constraints.Size;

import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.cql.Ordering;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.cql.PrimaryKeyType;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.Column;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.PrimaryKeyColumn;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.Table;

import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.uuid.Uuids;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
@Table("tacos")
public class Taco {

  @PrimaryKeyColumn(type=PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED)
  private UUID id = Uuids.timeBased();

  @NotNull
  @Size(min = 5, message = "Name must be at least 5 characters long")
  private String name;

  @PrimaryKeyColumn(type=PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED,
            ordering=Ordering.DESCENDING)
  private Date createdAt = new Date();

  @Size(min=1, message="You must choose at least 1 ingredient")
  @Column("ingredients")
  private List<IngredientUDT> ingredients = new ArrayList<>();

  public void addIngredient(Ingredient ingredient) {
    this.ingredients.add(TacoUDRUtils.toIngredientUDT(ingredient));
  }
}
```

As you can see, mapping the `Taco` class is a bit more involved. As with `Ingredient`, the `@Table` annotation is used to identify `tacos` as the name of the table that tacos should be written to. But that’s the only thing similar to `Ingredient`.

The `id` property is still your primary key, but it’s only one of two primary key columns. More specifically, the `id` property is annotated with `@PrimaryKeyColumn` with a type of `PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED`. This specifies that the id property serves as the partition key, used to determine to which Cassandra partition(s) each row of taco data will be written.

You’ll also notice that the id property is now a `UUID` instead of a Long. Although it’s not required, properties that hold a generated ID value are commonly of type UUID. Moreover, the `UUID` is initialized with a time-based UUID value for new `Taco` objects (but which may be overridden when reading an existing `Taco` from the database).

A little further down, you see the `createdAt` property that’s mapped as another primary key column. But in this case, the `type` attribute of `@PrimaryKeyColumn` is set to `PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED`, which designates the `createdAt` property as a clustering key. As mentioned earlier, clustering keys are used to determine the ordering of rows _within a partition_. More specifically, the ordering is set to descending order— therefore, within a given partition, newer rows appear first in the tacos table.

Finally, the `ingredients` property is now a `List` of `IngredientUDT` objects instead of a `List` of `Ingredient` objects. As you’ll recall, Cassandra tables are highly denormalized and may contain data that’s duplicated from other tables. Although the `ingredient` table will serve as the table of record for all available `ingredients`, the ingredients chosen for a taco will be duplicated in the `ingredients` column. Rather than simply reference one or more rows in the `ingredients` table, the `ingredients` property will contain full data for each chosen ingredient.

But why do you need to introduce a new `IngredientUDT` class? Why can’t you just reuse the `Ingredient` class? Put simply, columns that contain collections of data, such as the `ingredients` column, must be collections of native types (integers, strings, and so on) or user-defined types.

In Cassandra, user-defined types enable you to declare table columns that are richer than simple native types. Often they’re used as a denormalized analog for relational foreign keys. In contrast to foreign keys, which only hold a reference to a row in another table, columns with user-defined types actually carry data that may be copied from a row in another table. In the case of the ingredients column in the tacos table, it will contain a collection of data structures that define the ingredients themselves.

You can’t use the `Ingredient` class as a user-defined type, because the `@Table` annotation has already mapped it as an entity for persistence in Cassandra. Therefore, you must create a new class to define how ingredients will be stored in the `ingredients` column of the taco table. `IngredientUDT` (where `UDT` means _user-defined type_) is the class for the job, as shown here:

```java
package tacos;

import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.UserDefinedType;

import lombok.AccessLevel;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@Data
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE, force = true)
@UserDefinedType("ingredient")
public class IngredientUDT {

  private final String name;

  private final Ingredient.Type type;

}
```

Although `IngredientUDT` looks a lot like `Ingredient`, its mapping requirements are much simpler. It’s annotated with `@UserDefinedType` to identify it as a user-defined type in Cassandra. But otherwise, it’s a simple class with a few properties.

You’ll also note that the `IngredientUDT` class doesn’t include an id property. Although it could include a copy of the id property from the source `Ingredient`, that’s not necessary. In fact, the user-defined type may include any properties you wish—it doesn’t need to be a one-to-one mapping with any table definition.

I realize that it might be difficult to visualize how data in a user-defined type relatese to data that’s persisted to a table. Figure 4.1 shows the data model for the entire Taco Cloud database, including user-defined types.

![](../../assets/4.1.png)
**Figure 4.1 Instead of using foreign keys and joins, Cassandra tables are denormalized, with user-defined types containing data copied from related tables.**

Specific to the user-defined type that you just created, notice how `Taco` has a list of `IngredientUDT` objects, which holds data copied from `Ingredient` objects. When a `Taco` is persisted, it’s the `Taco` object and the list of `IngredientUDT` objects that’s persisted to the `tacos` table. The list of `IngredientUDT` objects is persisted entirely within the `ingredients` column.

Another way of looking at this that might help you understand how user-defined types are used is to query the database for rows from the tacos table. Using CQL and the `cqlsh` tool that comes with Cassandra, you see the following results:

```sql
cqlsh:tacocloud> select id, name, createdAt, ingredients from tacos;

id       | name      | createdat | ingredients
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------------------------
827390...| Carnivore | 2018-04...| [{name: 'Flour Tortilla', type: 'WRAP'},
                                    {name: 'Carnitas', type: 'PROTEIN'},
                                    {name: 'Sour Cream', type: 'SAUCE'},
                                    {name: 'Salsa', type: 'SAUCE'},
                                    {name: 'Cheddar', type: 'CHEESE'}]

(1 rows)
```

As you can see, the id, name, and createdat columns contain simple values. In that regard, they aren’t much different than what you’d expect from a similar query against a relational database. But the `ingredients` column is a little different. Because it’s defined as containing a collection of the user-defined ingredient type (defined by `IngredientUDT`), its value appears as a JSON array filled with JSON objects.

You likely noticed other user-defined types in figure 4.1. You’ll certainly be creating some more as you continue mapping your domain to Cassandra tables, including some that will be used by the `TacoOrder` class. The next listing shows the `TacoOrder` class, modified for Cassandra persistence.

**Listing 4.2 Mapping the TacoOrder class to a Cassandra orders table**

```java
package tacos;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.UUID;

import javax.validation.constraints.Digits;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank;
import javax.validation.constraints.Pattern;

import org.hibernate.validator.constraints.CreditCardNumber;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.Column;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.PrimaryKey;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.Table;

import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.uuid.Uuids;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
@Table("orders")
public class TacoOrder implements Serializable {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @PrimaryKey
  private UUID id = Uuids.timeBased();

  private Date placedAt = new Date();

  // delivery and credit card properties omitted for brevity's sake

  @Column("tacos")
  private List<TacoUDT> tacos = new ArrayList<>();

  public void addTaco(TacoUDT taco) {
    this.tacos.add(taco);
  }
}
```

Listing 4.2 purposefully omits many of the properties of `TacoOrder` that don’t lend themselves to a discussion of Cassandra data modeling. What’s left are a few properties and mappings, similar to how `Taco` was defined. `@Table` is used to map `TacoOrder` to the orders table, much as `@Table` has been used before. In this case, you’re unconcerned with ordering, so the `id` property is simply annotated with `@PrimaryKey`, designating it as both a partition key and a clustering key with default ordering.

The `tacos` property is of some interest in that it’s a `List<TacoUDT>` instead of a list of `Taco` objects. The relationship between `TacoOrder` and `Taco/TacoUDT` here is similar to the relationship between `Taco` and `Ingredient/IngredientUDT`. That is, rather than joining data from several rows in a separate table through foreign keys, the orders table will contain all of the pertinent taco data, optimizing the table for quick reads.

The `TacoUDT` class is quite similar to the `IngredientUDT` class, although it does include a collection that references another user-defined type, as follows:

```java
package tacos;

import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.UserDefinedType;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@UserDefinedType("taco")
public class TacoUDT {

  private final String name;
  private final List<IngredientUDT> ingredients;

}
```

Although it would have been nice to reuse the same domain classes you created in chapter 3, or at most to swap out some JPA annotations for Cassandra annotations, the nature of Cassandra persistence is such that it requires you to rethink how your data is modeled. But now that you’ve mapped your domain, you’re ready to write repositories.
