### 12.4.3 Deleting resources

`WebClient` also allows the removal of resources by way of its `delete()` method. For example, the following code deletes an ingredient for a given ID:

```java
Mono<Void> result = webClient
  .delete()
  .uri("/ingredients/{id}", ingredientId)
  .retrieve()
  .bodyToMono(Void.class);

result.subscribe();
```

As with `PUT` requests, `DELETE` requests donâ€™t typically have a payload. Once again, you return and subscribe to a `Mono<Void>` to send the request.
