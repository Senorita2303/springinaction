# Chapter 12. Developing reactive APIs

This chapter covers

* Using Spring WebFlux
* Writing and testing reactive controllers and
clients
* Consuming REST APIs
* Securing reactive web applications

Now that you’ve had a good introduction to reactive programming and Project Reactor, you’re ready to start applying those techniques in your Spring applications. In this chapter, we’re going to revisit some of the controllers you wrote in chapter 7 to take advantage of Spring’s reactive programming model.

More specifically, we’re going to take a look at Spring’s reactive web framework—Spring WebFlux. As you’ll quickly discover, Spring WebFlux is remarkably similar to Spring MVC, making it easy to apply, along with what you already know about building REST APIs in Spring.
