* Spring Security autoconfiguration is a great way to get started with security, but most applications will need to explicitly configure security to meet their unique security requirements.
* User details can be managed in user stores backed by relational databases, LDAP, or completely custom implementations.
* Spring Security automatically protects against CSRF attacks.
* Information about the authenticated user can be obtained via the `SecurityContext` object (returned from `SecurityContextHolder.getContext()`) or injected into controllers using `@AuthenticationPrincipal`.
