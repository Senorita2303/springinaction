## 14.4 Summary

* RSocket is an asynchronous binary protocol that offers four communication models: request-response, request-stream, fire-and-forget, and channel.
* Spring supports RSocket on the server through controllers and handler methods annotated with `@MessageHandler`.
* The `RSocketRequester` enables client-side communication with RSocket.
* In both cases, Spring’s RSocket support works through Reactor’s Flux and Mono reactive types for fully reactive communication.
* RSocket communication takes place over TCP by default but can also be transported over WebSocket to deal with firewall constraints and browser clients.
