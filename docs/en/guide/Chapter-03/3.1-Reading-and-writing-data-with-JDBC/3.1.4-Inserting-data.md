### 3.1.4 Inserting data

You’ve already had a glimpse into how to use `JdbcTemplate` to write data to the database. The `save()` method in `JdbcIngredientRepository` used the `update()` method of `JdbcTemplate` to save `Ingredient` objects to the database.

Although that was a good first example, it was perhaps a bit too simple. As you’ll soon see, saving data can be more involved than what `JdbcIngredientRepository` needed.

In our design, `TacoOrder` and `Taco` are part of an aggregate in which `TacoOrder` is the aggregate root. In other words, `Taco` objects don’t exist outside of the context of a `TacoOrder`. So, for now, we only need to define a repository to persist `TacoOrder` objects and, in turn, `Taco` objects along with them. Such a repository can be defined in a `OrderRepository` interface like this:

```java
package tacos.data;

import java.util.Optional;

import tacos.TacoOrder;

public interface OrderRepository {

  TacoOrder save(TacoOrder order);

}
```

Seems simple enough, right? Not so quick. When you save a `TacoOrder`, you also must save the `Taco` objects that go with it. And when you save the `Taco` objects, you’ll also need to save an object that represents the link between the `Taco` and each `Ingredient` that makes up the taco. The `IngredientRef` class defines that linking between `Taco` and `Ingredient` as follows:

```java
package tacos;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class IngredientRef {

  private final String ingredient;

}
```

Suffice it to say that the `save()` method will be a bit more interesting than the corresponding method you created earlier for saving a humble `Ingredient` object.

Another thing that the `save()` method will need to do is determine what ID is assigned to the order once it has been saved. Per the schema, the id property on the `Taco_Order` table is an `identity`, meaning that the database will determine the value automatically. But if the database determines the value for you, then you will need to know what that value is so that it can be returned in the `TacoOrder` object returned from the `save()` method. Fortunately, Spring offers a helpful `GeneratedKeyHolder` type that can help with that. But it involves working with a prepared statement, as shown in the following implementation of the `save()` method:

```java
package tacos.data;

import java.sql.Types;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

import org.springframework.asm.Type;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcOperations;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementCreator;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementCreatorFactory;
import org.springframework.jdbc.support.GeneratedKeyHolder;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

import tacos.IngredientRef;
import tacos.Taco;
import tacos.TacoOrder;

@Repository
public class JdbcOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {

  private JdbcOperations jdbcOperations;

  public JdbcOrderRepository(JdbcOperations jdbcOperations) {
    this.jdbcOperations = jdbcOperations;
  }

  @Override
  @Transactional
  public TacoOrder save(TacoOrder order) {
    PreparedStatementCreatorFactory pscf =
      new PreparedStatementCreatorFactory(
        "insert into Taco_Order "
        + "(delivery_name, delivery_street, delivery_city, "
        + "delivery_state, delivery_zip, cc_number, "
        + "cc_expiration, cc_cvv, placed_at) "
        + "values (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)",
        Types.VARCHAR, Types.VARCHAR, Types.VARCHAR,
        Types.VARCHAR, Types.VARCHAR, Types.VARCHAR,
        Types.VARCHAR, Types.VARCHAR, Types.TIMESTAMP
    );
    pscf.setReturnGeneratedKeys(true);

    order.setPlacedAt(new Date());
    PreparedStatementCreator psc =
      pscf.newPreparedStatementCreator(
        Arrays.asList(
          order.getDeliveryName(),
          order.getDeliveryStreet(),
          order.getDeliveryCity(),
          order.getDeliveryState(),
          order.getDeliveryZip(),
          order.getCcNumber(),
          order.getCcExpiration(),
          order.getCcCVV(),
          order.getPlacedAt()));

    GeneratedKeyHolder keyHolder = new GeneratedKeyHolder();
    jdbcOperations.update(psc, keyHolder);
    long orderId = keyHolder.getKey().longValue();
    order.setId(orderId);

    List<Taco> tacos = order.getTacos();
    int i=0;
    for (Taco taco : tacos) {
      saveTaco(orderId, i++, taco);
    }
    return order;
  }
}
```

There appears to be a lot going on in the `save()` method, but we can break it down into only a handful of significant steps. First, you create a `PreparedStatementCreatorFactory` that describes the `insert` query along with the types of the query’s input fields. Because you’ll later need to fetch the saved order’s ID, you also will need to call `setReturnGeneratedKeys(true)`.

After defining the `PreparedStatementCreatorFactory`, you use it to create a `PreparedStatementCreator`, passing in the values from the TacoOrder object that will be persisted. The last field given to the `PreparedStatementCreator` is the date that the order is created, which you’ll also need to set on the TacoOrder object itself so that the returned TacoOrder will have that information available.

Now that you have a `PreparedStatementCreator` in hand, you’re ready to actually save the order data by calling the `update()` method on `JdbcTemplate`, passing in the `PreparedStatementCreator` and a `GeneratedKeyHolder`. After the order data has been saved, the `GeneratedKeyHolder` will contain the value of the `id` field as assigned by the database and should be copied into the `TacoOrder` object’s `id` property.

At this point, the order has been saved, but you need to also save the `Taco` objects associated with the order. You can do that by calling `saveTaco()` for each Taco in the order.

The `saveTaco()` method is quite similar to the `save()` method, as you can see here:

```java
private long saveTaco(Long orderId, int orderKey, Taco taco) {
  taco.setCreatedAt(new Date());
  PreparedStatementCreatorFactory pscf =
      new PreparedStatementCreatorFactory(
    "insert into Taco "
    + "(name, created_at, taco_order, taco_order_key) "
    + "values (?, ?, ?, ?)",
    Types.VARCHAR, Types.TIMESTAMP, Type.LONG, Type.LONG
  );
  pscf.setReturnGeneratedKeys(true);

  PreparedStatementCreator psc =
    pscf.newPreparedStatementCreator(
      Arrays.asList(
        taco.getName(),
        taco.getCreatedAt(),
        orderId,
        orderKey));

  GeneratedKeyHolder keyHolder = new GeneratedKeyHolder();
  jdbcOperations.update(psc, keyHolder);
  long tacoId = keyHolder.getKey().longValue();
  taco.setId(tacoId);

  saveIngredientRefs(tacoId, taco.getIngredients());

  return tacoId;
}
```

Step by step, `saveTaco()` mirrors the structure of save(), albeit for `Taco` data instead of `TacoOrder` data. In the end, it makes a call to `saveIngredientRefs()` to create a row in the `Ingredient_Ref` table to link the Taco row to an `Ingredient` row. The `saveIngredientRefs()` method looks like this:

```java
private void saveIngredientRefs(
  long tacoId, List<IngredientRef> ingredientRefs) {
  int key = 0;
  for (IngredientRef ingredientRef : ingredientRefs) {
    jdbcOperations.update(
      "insert into Ingredient_Ref (ingredient, taco, taco_key) "
      + "values (?, ?, ?)",
      ingredientRef.getIngredient(), tacoId, key++);
  }
}
```

Thankfully, the `saveIngredientRefs()` method is much simpler. It cycles through a list of `Ingredient` objects, saving each into the `Ingredient_Ref` table. It also has a local key variable that is used as an index to ensure that the ordering of the ingredients stays intact.

All that’s left to do with `OrderRepository` is to inject it into `OrderController` and use it when saving an order. The following listing shows the changes necessary for injecting the repository.

**Listing 3.11 Injecting and using OrderRepository**
```java
package tacos.web;
import javax.validation.Valid;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.validation.Errors;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.SessionAttributes;
import org.springframework.web.bind.support.SessionStatus;

import tacos.TacoOrder;
import tacos.data.OrderRepository;

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/orders")
@SessionAttributes("tacoOrder")
public class OrderController {

  private OrderRepository orderRepo;
  
  public OrderController(OrderRepository orderRepo) {
    this.orderRepo = orderRepo;
  }

  // ...
  @PostMapping
  public String processOrder(@Valid TacoOrder order, Errors errors, SessionStatus sessionStatus) {
    if (errors.hasErrors()) {
      return "orderForm";
    }

    orderRepo.save(order);
    sessionStatus.setComplete();

    return "redirect:/";
  }
}
```

As you can see, the constructor takes an `OrderRepository` as a parameter and assigns it to an instance variable that it will use in the `processOrder()` method. Speaking of the `processOrder()` method, it has been changed to call the `save()` method on the OrderRepository instead of logging the `TacoOrder` object.

Spring’s `JdbcTemplate` makes working with relational databases significantly simpler than with plain vanilla JDBC. But even with `JdbcTemplate`, some persistence tasks are still challenging, especially when persisting nested domain objects in an aggregate. If only there were a way to work with JDBC that was even simpler.

Let’s have a look at Spring Data JDBC, which makes working with JDBC insanely easy — even when persisting aggregates.
