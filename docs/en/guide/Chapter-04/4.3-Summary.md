* Spring Data supports repositories for a variety of NoSQL databases, including Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.
* The programming model for creating repositories differs very little across different underlying databases.
* Working with nonrelational databases demands an understanding of how to model data appropriately for how the database ultimately stores the data.
