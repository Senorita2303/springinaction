## 11.4 Summary

* Reactive programming involves creating pipelines through which data flows.
* The Reactive Streams specification defines four types: `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, `Subscription`, and `Transformer` (which is a combination of `Publisher` and `Subscriber`).
* Project Reactor implements Reactive Streams and abstracts stream definitions into two primary types, `Flux` and `Mono`, each of which offers several hundred operations.
* Spring leverages Reactor to create reactive controllers, repositories, REST clients, and other reactive framework support.
