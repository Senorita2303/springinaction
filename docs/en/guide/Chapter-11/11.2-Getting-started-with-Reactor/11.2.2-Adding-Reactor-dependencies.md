### 11.2.2 Adding Reactor dependencies

To get started with Reactor, add the following dependency to the project build:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Reactor also provides some great testing support. You’re going to write a lot of tests around your Reactor code, so you’ll definitely want to add the next dependency to your build:

```html
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

I’m assuming that you’re adding these dependencies to a Spring Boot project, which handles dependency management for you, so there’s no need to specify the `<version>` element for the dependencies. But if you want to use Reactor in a non–Spring Boot project, you’ll need to set up Reactor’s BOM (bill of materials) in the build. The following dependency management entry adds Reactor’s 2020.0.4 release to the build:

```html
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
      <artifactId>reactor-bom</artifactId>
      <version>2020.0.4</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

The examples we’ll work with in this chapter are standalone and unrelated to the Taco Cloud projects we’ve been working with. Therefore, it may be best to create a fresh new Spring project with the Reactor dependencies in the build and work from there.

Now that Reactor is in your project build, you can start creating reactive pipelines with `Mono` and `Flux`. For the remainder of this chapter, we’ll walk through several operations offered by `Mono` and `Flux`.
