### 13.2.2 Defining reactive MongoDB repositories

Now we’ll need to define two repositories, one for the `TacoOrder` aggregate root and another for Ingredient. We won’t need a repository for `Taco` because it is a child of the TacoOrder root.

The `IngredientRepository` interface, shown here, should be familiar to you by now:

```java
package tacos.data;

import org.springframework.data.repository.reactive.ReactiveCrudRepository;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;

import tacos.Ingredient;

@CrossOrigin(origins="*")
public interface IngredientRepository
      extends ReactiveCrudRepository<Ingredient, String> {
}
```

This `IngredientRepository` interface is only slightly different from the one we defined in chapter 4 in that it extends `ReactiveCrudRepository` instead of `CrudRepository`. And it differs from the one we created for Spring Data R2DBC persistence only in that it doesn’t include the `findBySlug()` method.

Likewise, `OrderRepository` is all but identical to the same MongoDB repository we created in chapter 4, shown next:

```java
package tacos.data;

import org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable;
import org.springframework.data.repository.reactive.ReactiveCrudRepository;

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import tacos.TacoOrder;
import tacos.User;

public interface OrderRepository
      extends ReactiveCrudRepository<TacoOrder, String> {

  Flux<TacoOrder> findByUserOrderByPlacedAtDesc(
      User user, Pageable pageable);

}

```

Ultimately, the only difference between reactive and nonreactive MongoDB repositories is whether they extend `ReactiveCrudRepository` or `CrudRepository`. In choosing to extend `ReactiveCrudRepository`, however, clients of these repositories must be prepared to deal with reactive types like `Flux` and `Mono`. That becomes apparent as we write tests for the reactive repositories, which is what we’ll do next.
