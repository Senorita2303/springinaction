### 13.2.3 Testing reactive MongoDB repositories

The key to writing tests for MongoDB repositories is to annotate the test class with `@DataMongoTest`. This annotation performs a function similar to the `@DataR2dbcTest` annotation that we used earlier in this chapter. It ensures that a Spring application context is created with the generated repositories available as beans to be injected into the test. From there, the test can use those injected repositories to set up test data and perform other operations against the database.

For example, consider `IngredientRepositoryTest` in the next listing, which tests `IngredientRepository`, asserting that `Ingredient` objects can be written to and read from the database.

**Listing 13.15 Testing a reactive Mongo repository**

```java
package tacos.data;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import java.util.ArrayList;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.mongo.DataMongoTest;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.test.StepVerifier;
import tacos.Ingredient;
import tacos.Ingredient.Type;

@DataMongoTest
public class IngredientRepositoryTest {

  @Autowired
  IngredientRepository ingredientRepo;

  @BeforeEach
  public void setup() {
    Flux<Ingredient> deleteAndInsert = ingredientRepo.deleteAll()
        .thenMany(ingredientRepo.saveAll(
          Flux.just(
            new Ingredient("FLTO", "Flour Tortilla", Type.WRAP),
            new Ingredient("GRBF", "Ground Beef", Type.PROTEIN),
            new Ingredient("CHED", "Cheddar Cheese", Type.CHEESE)
        )));
    StepVerifier.create(deleteAndInsert)
          .expectNextCount(3)
          .verifyComplete();
  }

  @Test
  public void shouldSaveAndFetchIngredients() {

    StepVerifier.create(ingredientRepo.findAll())
      .recordWith(ArrayList::new)
      .thenConsumeWhile(x -> true)
      .consumeRecordedWith(ingredients -> {
        assertThat(ingredients).hasSize(3);
        assertThat(ingredients).contains(
          new Ingredient("FLTO", "Flour Tortilla", Type.WRAP));
        assertThat(ingredients).contains(
          new Ingredient("GRBF", "Ground Beef", Type.PROTEIN));
        assertThat(ingredients).contains(
          new Ingredient("CHED", "Cheddar Cheese", Type.CHEESE));
      })
      .verifyComplete();

    StepVerifier.create(ingredientRepo.findById("FLTO"))
      .assertNext(ingredient -> {
        ingredient.equals(new Ingredient("FLTO", "Flour Tortilla", Type.WRAP));
      });
  }

}

```

This test is similar to, but still slightly different from, the R2DBC-based repository test we wrote earlier in this chapter. It starts by writing three `Ingredient` objects to the database. Then, it employs two `StepVerifier` instances to verify that `Ingredient` objects can be read through the repository, first as a collection of all `Ingredient` objects and then fetching a single `Ingredient` by its ID.

Also, just as with the R2DBC-based test from earlier, the `@DataMongoTest` annotation will seek out a `@SpringBootConfiguration`-annotated class for creating the application context. A test just like the one created earlier will work here, too.

What’s unique here is that the first `StepVerifier` collects all of the `Ingredient` objects into an `ArrayList` and then asserts that the `ArrayList` contains each `Ingredient`. The `findAll()` method doesn’t guarantee a consistent ordering of the resulting documents, which makes the use of `assertNext()` or `expectNext()` prone to fail. By collecting all resulting `Ingredient` objects into a list, we can assert that the list has all three objects, regardless of their order.

A test for `OrderRepository` looks quite similar, as shown here.

**Listing 13.16 Testing the Mongo OrderRepository**

```java
package tacos.data;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.mongo.DataMongoTest;

import reactor.test.StepVerifier;
import tacos.Ingredient;
import tacos.Taco;
import tacos.TacoOrder;
import tacos.Ingredient.Type;

@DataMongoTest
public class OrderRepositoryTest {

  @Autowired
  OrderRepository orderRepo;

  @BeforeEach
  public void setup() {
    orderRepo.deleteAll().subscribe();
  }

  @Test
  public void shouldSaveAndFetchOrders() {
  TacoOrder order = createOrder();

  StepVerifier
    .create(orderRepo.save(order))
    .expectNext(order)
    .verifyComplete();

  StepVerifier
    .create(orderRepo.findById(order.getId()))
    .expectNext(order)
    .verifyComplete();

  StepVerifier
    .create(orderRepo.findAll())
    .expectNext(order)
    .verifyComplete();

  }
  private TacoOrder createOrder() {
    TacoOrder order = new TacoOrder();
    ...
    return order;
  }

}
```

The first thing that the `shouldSaveAndFetchOrders()` method does is construct an order, complete with customer and payment information and a couple of tacos. (For brevity’s sake, I’ve left out the details of the `createOrder()` method.) It then uses a `StepVerifier` to save the `TacoOrder` object and assert that the `save()` method returns the saved `TacoOrder`. It then attempts to fetch the order by its ID and asserts that it receives the full `TacoOrder`. Finally, it fetches all `TacoOrder` objects—there should be only one—and asserts it is the expected `TacoOrder`.

As mentioned earlier, you’ll need a MongoDB server available and listening on port 27017 to run this test. The Flapdoodle embedded MongoDB doesn’t work well with reactive repositories. If you have Docker installed on your machine, you can easily start a MongoDB server exposed on port 27017 like this:

```bash
$ docker run -p27017:27017 mongo
```

Other ways to get a MongoDB setup are possible. Consult the documentation at [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/) for more details.

Now that we’ve seen how to create reactive repositories for R2BDC and MongoDB, let’s have a look at one more Spring Data option for reactive persistence: Cassandra.
