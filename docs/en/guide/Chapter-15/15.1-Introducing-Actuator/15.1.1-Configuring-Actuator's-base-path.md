### 15.1.1 Configuring Actuator's base path

By default, the paths for all the endpoints shown in table 15.1 are prefixed with /actuator. This mean that, for example, if you wish to retrieve health information about your application from Actuator, then issuing a `GET` request for /actuator/health will return the information you need.

The Actuator prefix path can be changed by setting the `management.endpoint.web.base-path property`. For example, if you’d rather the prefix be /management, you would set the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property like this:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      base-path: /management
```

With this property set as shown, you’d need to make a GET request for /management/health to obtain the application’s health information.

Whether or not you decide to change the Actuator base path, all Actuator endpoints in this chapter will be referred to without the base path for the sake of brevity. For example, when the /health endpoint is mentioned, it is the /{base path}/health endpoint that is intended, or more precisely, the /actuator/health endpoint if the base path hasn’t been changed.
