### 5.2.2 Customizing user authentication

In the previous chapter, you settled on using Spring Data JPA as your persistence option for all taco, ingredient, and order data. It would thus make sense to persist user data in the same way. If you do so, the data will ultimately reside in a relational database, so you could use JDBC authentication. But it’d be even better to leverage the Spring Data JPA repository used to store users.

First things first, though. Let’s create the domain object and repository interface that represents and persists user information.

#### DEFINING THE USER DOMAIN AND PERSISTENCE

When Taco Cloud customers register with the application, they’ll need to provide more
than just a username and password. They’ll also give you their full name, address, and
phone number. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, including prepopulating the order form (not to mention potential marketing opportunities).

To capture all of that information, you’ll create a `User` class, as follows.

**Listing 5.3 Defining a user entity**

```java
package tacos;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import org.springframework.security.core.GrantedAuthority;
import org.springframework.security.core.authority.
                      SimpleGrantedAuthority;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
import lombok.AccessLevel;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@Entity
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor(access=AccessLevel.PRIVATE, force=true)
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class User implements UserDetails {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
  private Long id;

  private final String username;
  private final String password;
  private final String fullname;
  private final String street;
  private final String city;
  private final String state;
  private final String zip;
  private final String phoneNumber;

  @Override
  public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
    return Arrays.asList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_USER"));
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isAccountNonExpired() {
    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isAccountNonLocked() {
    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isCredentialsNonExpired() {
    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isEnabled() {
    return true;
  }

}
```

The first thing to notice about this `User` type is that it’s not the same as the User class we used when creating the in-memory user details service. This one has more details about the user that we’ll need to fulfill taco orders, including the user’s address and contact information.

You’ve also probably noticed that the `User` class is a bit more involved than any of the other entities defined in chapter 3. In addition to defining a handful of properties, `User` also implements the `UserDetails` interface from Spring Security.

Implementations of `UserDetails` will provide some essential user information to the framework, such as what authorities are granted to the user and whether the user’s account is enabled.

The `getAuthorities()` method should return a collection of authorities granted to the user. The various `is*` methods return a boolean to indicate whether the user’s account is enabled, locked, or expired.

For your `User` entity, the `getAuthorities()` method simply returns a collection indicating that all users will have been granted `ROLE_USER` authority. And, at least for now, Taco Cloud has no need to disable users, so all of the `is*` methods return true to indicate that the users are active.

With the `User` entity defined, you can now define the repository interface as follows:

```java
package tacos.data;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import tacos.User;

public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  User findByUsername(String username);

}
```

In addition to the CRUD operations provided by extending `CrudRepository`, `UserRepository` defines a `findByUsername()` method that you’ll use in the user details service to look up a `User` by their username.

As you learned in chapter 3, Spring Data JPA automatically generates the implementation of this interface at run time. Therefore, you’re now ready to write a custom user details service that uses this repository

#### CREATING A USER DETAILS SERVICE

As you’ll recall, the `UserDetailsService` interface defines only a single `loadUserByUsername()` method. That means it is a functional interface and can be implemented as a lambda instead of as a full-blown implementation class. Because all we really need is for our custom `UserDetailsService` to delegate to the `UserRepository`, it can be simply declared as a bean using the following configuration method.

**Listing 5.4 Defining a custom user details service bean**

```java
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService(UserRepository userRepo) {
  return username -> {
    User user = userRepo.findByUsername(username);
    if (user != null) return user;

    throw new UsernameNotFoundException("User '" + username + "' not found");
  };
}
```

The `userDetailsService()` method is given a `UserRepository` as a parameter. To
create the bean, it returns a lambda that takes a username parameter and uses it to call
`findByUsername()` on the given `UserRepository`.

The `loadByUsername()` method has one simple rule: it must never return `null`.
Therefore, if the call to `findByUsername()` returns `null`, the lambda will throw a
`UsernameNotFoundException` (which is defined by Spring Security). Otherwise, the
User that was found will be returned.

Now that you have a custom user details service that reads user information via a JPA
repository, you just need a way to get users into the database in the first place. You need
to create a registration page for Taco Cloud patrons to register with the application.

#### REGISTERING USERS

Although Spring Security handles many aspects of security, it really isn’t directly
involved in the process of user registration, so you’re going to rely on a little bit of
Spring MVC to handle that task. The `RegistrationController` class in the following
listing presents and processes registration forms.

**Listing 5.5 A user registration controller**

```java
package tacos.security;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import tacos.data.UserRepository;
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/register")
public class RegistrationController {

  private UserRepository userRepo;
  private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

  public RegistrationController(
    UserRepository userRepo, PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
      this.userRepo = userRepo;
      this.passwordEncoder = passwordEncoder;
  }

  @GetMapping
  public String registerForm() {
    return "registration";
  }

  @PostMapping
  public String processRegistration(RegistrationForm form) {
    userRepo.save(form.toUser(passwordEncoder));
    return "redirect:/login";
  }
}
```

Like any typical Spring MVC controller, `RegistrationController` is annotated with `@Controller` to designate it as a controller and to mark it for component scanning. It’s also annotated with `@RequestMapping` such that it will handle requests whose path is /register.

More specifically, a `GET` request for /register will be handled by the `registerForm()` method, which simply returns a logical view name of `registration`. The following listing shows a Thymeleaf template that defines the `registration` view.

**Listing 5.6 A Thymeleaf registration form view**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">

  <head>
    <title>Taco Cloud</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Register</h1>

    <img th:src="@{/images/TacoCloud.png}"/>
    
    <form method="POST" th:action="@{/register}" id="registerForm">
      <label for="username">Username: </label>
      <input type="text" name="username"/><br/>
      <label for="password">Password: </label>
      <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>
      <label for="confirm">Confirm password: </label>
      <input type="password" name="confirm"/><br/>
      <label for="fullname">Full name: </label>
      <input type="text" name="fullname"/><br/>
      <label for="street">Street: </label>
      <input type="text" name="street"/><br/>
      <label for="city">City: </label>
      <input type="text" name="city"/><br/>
      <label for="state">State: </label>
      <input type="text" name="state"/><br/>
      <label for="zip">Zip: </label>
      <input type="text" name="zip"/><br/>
      <label for="phone">Phone: </label>
      <input type="text" name="phone"/><br/>
      <input type="submit" value="Register"/>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

When the form is submitted, the `processRegistration()` method handles the HTTPS `POST` request. The form fields will be bound to a `RegistrationForm` object by Spring MVC and passed into the `processRegistration()` method for processing. `RegistrationForm` is defined in the following class:

```java
package tacos.security;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import lombok.Data;
import tacos.User;

@Data
public class RegistrationForm {

  private String username;
  private String password;
  private String fullname;
  private String street;
  private String city;
  private String state;
  private String zip;
  private String phone;

  public User toUser(PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
    return new User(
      username, passwordEncoder.encode(password),
      fullname, street, city, state, zip, phone);
  }

}
```

For the most part, `RegistrationForm` is just a basic Lombok class with a handful of properties. But the `toUser()` method uses those properties to create a new `User` object, which is what `processRegistration()` will save, using the injected UserRepository.

You’ve no doubt noticed that `RegistrationController` is injected with a `PasswordEncoder`. This is the exact same `PasswordEncoder` bean you declared earlier. When processing a form submission, `RegistrationController` passes it to the `toUser()` method, which uses it to encode the password before saving it to the database. In this way, the submitted password is written in an encoded form, and the user details service will be able to authenticate against that encoded password.

Now the Taco Cloud application has complete user registration and authentication support. But if you start it up at this point, you’ll notice that you can’t even get to the registration page without being prompted to log in. That’s because, by default, all requests require authentication. Let’s look at how web requests are intercepted and secured so you can fix this strange chicken-and-egg situation.
