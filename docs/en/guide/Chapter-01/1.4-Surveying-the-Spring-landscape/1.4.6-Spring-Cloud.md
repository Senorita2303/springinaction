### 1.4.6 Spring Cloud

The application development world is entering a new era where we’ll no longer develop our applications as single-deployment, unit monoliths and will instead compose applications from several individual deployment units known as microservices.

Microservices are a hot topic, addressing several practical development and runtime concerns. In doing so, however, they bring to fore their own challenges. Those challenges are met head-on by Spring Cloud, a collection of projects for developing cloud-native applications with Spring.

Spring Cloud covers a lot of ground, and it’d be impossible to cover it all in this book. For a complete discussion of Spring Cloud, I suggest taking a look at Cloud Native Spring in Action by Thomas Vitale（Manning, 2020, [www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action)）。
