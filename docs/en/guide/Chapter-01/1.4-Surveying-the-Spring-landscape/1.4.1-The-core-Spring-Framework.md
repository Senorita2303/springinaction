### 1.4.1 The core Spring Framework

As you might expect, the core Spring Framework is the foundation of everything else in the Spring universe. It provides the core container and dependency injection framework. But it also provides a few other essential features.

Among these is Spring MVC, Spring’s web framework. You’ve already seen how to use Spring MVC to write a controller class to handle web requests. What you’ve not yet seen, however, is that Spring MVC can also be used to create REST APIs that produce non-HTML output. We’re going to dig more into Spring MVC in chapter 2 and then take another look at how to use it to create REST APIs in chapter 7.

The core Spring Framework also offers some elemental data persistence support, specifically, template-based JDBC support. You’ll see how to use JdbcTemplate in chapter 3.

Spring includes support for reactive-style programming, including a new reactive web framework called Spring WebFlux that borrows heavily from Spring MVC. You’ll look at Spring’s reactive programming model in part 3 and Spring WebFlux specifically in chapter 12.
