### 1.4.5 Spring Integration and Spring Batch

At some point, most applications will need to integrate with other applications or even with other components of the same application. Several patterns of application integration have emerged to address these needs. Spring Integration and Spring Batch provide the implementation of these patterns for Spring applications.

Spring Integration addresses real-time integration where data is processed as it’s made available. In contrast, Spring Batch addresses batched integration where data is allowed to collect for a time until some trigger (perhaps a time trigger) signals that it’s time for the batch of data to be processed. You’ll explore Spring Integration in chapter 10.
