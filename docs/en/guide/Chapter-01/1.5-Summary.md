## 1.5 Summary

* Spring aims to make developer challenges easy, like creating web applications, working with databases, securing applications, and microservices.
* Spring Boot builds on top of Spring to make Spring even easier with simplified dependency management, automatic configuration, and runtime insights.
* Spring applications can be initialized using the Spring Initializr, which is webbased and supported natively in most Java development environments.
* The components, commonly referred to as beans, in a Spring application context can be declared explicitly with Java or XML, discovered by component scanning, or automatically configured with Spring Boot autoconfigurations.
