### 7.3.3 DELETEing resources

Suppose that Taco Cloud no longer offers an ingredient and wants it completely removed as an option. To make that happen, you can call the `delete()` method from `RestTemplate` as follows:

```java
public void deleteIngredient(Ingredient ingredient) {
  rest.delete("http://localhost:8080/ingredients/{id}",
              ingredient.getId());
  }
```

In this example, only the URL (specified as a `String`) and a URL variable value are given to `delete()`. But as with the other RestTemplate methods, the URL could be specified as a `URI` object or the URL parameters given as a Map.
