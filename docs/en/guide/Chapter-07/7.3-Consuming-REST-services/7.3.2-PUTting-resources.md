### 7.3.2 PUTting resources

For sending HTTP PUT requests, `RestTemplate` offers the `put()` method. All three overloaded variants of `put()` accept an Object that is to be serialized and sent to the given URL. As for the URL itself, it can be specified as a `URI` object or as a `String`. And like `getForObject()` and `getForEntity()`, the URL variables can be provided as either a variable argument list or as a `Map`.

Suppose that you want to replace an ingredient resource with the data from a new `Ingredient` object. The following code should do the trick:

```java
public void updateIngredient(Ingredient ingredient) {
  rest.put("http://localhost:8080/ingredients/{id}",
              ingredient, ingredient.getId());
}
```

Here the URL is given as a `String` and has a placeholder that’s substituted by the given `Ingredient` object’s `id` property. The data to be sent is the `Ingredient` object itself. The `put()` method returns void, so there’s nothing you need to do to handle a return value.
