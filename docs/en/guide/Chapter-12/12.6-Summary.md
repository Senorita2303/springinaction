## 12.6 Summary

* Spring WebFlux offers a reactive web framework whose programming model mirrors that of Spring MVC and even shares many of the same annotations.
* Spring also offers a functional programming model as an alternative to Spring WebFlux’s annotation-based programming model.
*  Reactive controllers can be tested with `WebTestClient`.
* On the client side, Spring offers `WebClient`, a reactive analog to Spring’s `RestTemplate`.
* Although WebFlux has some significant implications for the underlying mechanisms for securing a web application, Spring Security 5 supports reactive security with a programming model that isn’t dramatically different from nonreactive Spring MVC applications.
