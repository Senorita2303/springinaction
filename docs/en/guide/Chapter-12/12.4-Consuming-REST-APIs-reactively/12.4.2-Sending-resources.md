### 12.4.2 Sending resources

Sending data with WebClient isn’t much different from receiving data. As an example, let’s say that you have a `Mono<Ingredient>` and want to send a POST request with the Ingredient that’s published by the Mono to the URI with a relative path of /ingredients. All you must do is use the post() method instead of get() and specify that the Mono is to be used to populate the request body by calling body() as follows:

```java
Mono<Ingredient> ingredientMono = Mono.just(
    new Ingredient("INGC", "Ingredient C", Ingredient.Type.VEGGIES));

Mono<Ingredient> result = webClient
  .post()
  .uri("/ingredients")
  .body(ingredientMono, Ingredient.class)
  .retrieve()
  .bodyToMono(Ingredient.class);

result.subscribe(i -> { ... });
```

If you don’t have a `Mono` or `Flux` to send, but instead have the raw domain object on hand, you can use `bodyValue()`. For example, suppose that instead of a `Mono <Ingredient>`, you have an `Ingredient` that you want to send in the request body, as shown next:

```java
IIngedient ingredient = ...;

Mono<Ingredient> result = webClient
  .post()
  .uri("/ingredients")
  .bodyValue(ingredient)
  .retrieve()
  .bodyToMono(Ingredient.class);

result.subscribe(i -> { ... });
```

Instead of a `POST` request, if you want to update an `Ingredient` with a `PUT` request, you call `put()` instead of `post()` and adjust the URI path accordingly, like so:

```java
Mono<Void> result = webClient
  .put()
  .uri("/ingredients/{id}", ingredient.getId())
  .bodyValue(ingredient)
  .retrieve()
  .bodyToMono(Void.class);

result.subscribe();
```

`PUT` requests typically have empty response payloads, so you must ask `bodyToMono()` to return a `Mono` of type `Void`. On subscribing to that `Mono`, the request will be sent.
