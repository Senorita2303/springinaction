### 6.1.5 Using special property values

When setting properties, you aren’t limited to declaring their values as hardcoded `String` and numeric values. Instead, you can derive their values from other configuration properties.

For example, suppose (for whatever reason) you want to set a property named `greeting.welcome` to echo the value of another property named `spring.application.name`. To achieve this, you could use the `${}` placeholder markers when setting `greeting.welcome` as follows:

```yaml
greeting:
  welcome: ${spring.application.name}
```

You can even embed that placeholder amid other text, as shown here:

```yaml
greeting:
  welcome: You are using ${spring.application.name}
```

As you’ve seen, configuring Spring’s own components with configuration properties makes it easy to inject values into those components’ properties and to fine-tune autoconfiguration. Configuration properties aren’t exclusive to the beans that Spring creates. With a small amount of effort, you can take advantage of configuration properties in your own beans. Let’s see how.
